<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>


<p>As the app is very young and in a pre-alpha state, you will have to manually edit code variables, as well as to create at least two Hedera Testnet Accounts (https://portal.hedera.com/register).</br>
Once done that, download the repository and create a .env file with the PRIVATE_KEY and ACCOUNT_ID information you retrieved from the Hedera website. </br>
Lastly, perform a npm install and start the app with the command "node index.js".</br>
If no errors are encountered, the results of the creation and transactions should be visible in the terminal.  <p>
